    <li>Kia Stinger GT-Line (starting at $36,740, estimated)</li>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Referring to the GT-Line as the Stinger’s entry-level grade doesn’t seem
        fitting. However, it is just that. A 300-hp 2.5-liter turbocharged
        4-cylinder engine provides thrust. With RWD, its government-estimated
        combined city and highway mileage is 25 mpg. Pony up $2,200 for AWD, and
        that number drops by one mpg. Standard on the GT-Line are 18-inch alloy
        wheels, high-performance dampers, and LED exterior lights (auto on-off
        headlights, taillights, and daytime running lights). Kia also includes
        heated power-folding outboard rearview mirrors with integrated turn
        signals, and rain-sensing wipers. A tilt-telescopic steering wheel, a
        4.2-inch driver-information display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,
        and aluminum pedals are standard, as well. Kia doesn’t skimp on the
        Stinger’s seating with the GT-Line. You get leather seating, a 12-way
        power-adjustable driver’s seat, a 60/40 split-folding rear seat, and
        heated front seats. More standard goodies are a leather-wrapped
        flat-bottom steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless
        entry with push-button start, and remote keyless entry. Comprising the
        infotainment system are a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, a
        9-speaker audio system, satellite-radio capability, and Bluetooth. Apple
        CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless phone charging are included, too. To
        gain a power sunroof, a 15-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, and an
        8-way power-adjustable passenger seat, kick in another $2,300 for the
        Sun & Sound Package. Adding the $1,215 destination fee to the GT-Line
        base price brings the total to $37,955. With no money down, financing
        for 60 months at 3% interest works out to about $682 per month.

      <li>
        <b>Rain-sensing wipers</b> – When the system senses moisture on the
        windshield, it automatically engages the wipers. The wiper speed adjusts
        according to the volume of the rain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Power-adjustable driver’s seat</b> – This leather-covered heated seat
        provides 12-way adjustment, including 4-way power lumbar support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Keyless entry</b> – If the key fob is on your person, the doors
        automatically unlock when you touch the door handle. It pairs with
        push-button start.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <li>Kia Stinger GT1 (starting at $44,430, estimated)</li>
    <p>
      Kia heats things up by dropping a 368-hp 3.3-liter twin-turbo V6 engine
      under the hood of the GT1 and GT2. The EPA combined mileage is 20 mpg with
      RWD or AWD. In addition to sharing the engine, the GT1 and GT2 both come
      with launch control and a limited-slip rear differential. The performance
      elements mentioned above conspire to create most of the price difference
      between the GT-Line and the GT1. The GT1 builds on the GT-Line, adding
      19-inch alloy wheels, a power sunroof, multi-colored LED cabin accent
      lighting, an LED cargo light, and aluminum interior accents. Also standard
      is an 8-way power-adjustable passenger seat with a height adjuster. Beyond
      AWD and some upgraded paints, Kia doesn’t offer any factory-installed
      options for the GT1. Adding the destination fee to the GT1 base price
      totals $45,555. At 3% interest, financing for 60 months with no money down
      works out to about $819 per month.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Turbo V6</b> – By Kia’s stopwatch, the GT1 can rabbit to 60 miles per
        hour from a stop in 4.7 seconds. This is thanks to the 368-hp 3.3-liter
        twin-turbo V6 that also generates 376 lb-ft of torque.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Limited-slip rear differential</b> – When engaged, it moves engine
        torque across the rear axle, providing power to the wheel with grip when
        the other is slipping.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Launch control</b> – This electronic aid achieves maximum
        acceleration from a standstill.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <li>Kia Stinger GT2 (starting at $51,940, estimated)</li>
    <p>
      The performance top-dog among Stinger grades, the GT2 adds an
      electronically controlled suspension, projection LED headlights, and
      Dynamic Low-Beam headlight assist. Other standard features are
      auto-dimming outboard mirrors, a hands-free power rear hatch, a
      power-adjustable steering wheel, and a 7-inch instrument cluster. Also
      included are a Homelink transceiver, Nappa leather seating, a 16-way
      power-adjustable driver’s seat, and a 12-way power-adjustable passenger
      seat. Heated rear seats, ventilated front seats, a 15-speaker Harman
      Kardon audio system, a surround-view camera, and a head-up display are
      also standard. For $1,295, you can add the Scorpion Package, which is an
      appearance group featuring unique 19-inch alloy wheels, black fender trim,
      and dark exhaust tips. Exterior colors for the Scorpion Package include
      white, black, or silver. Adding the destination fee to the GT2 base price
      equals $53,155. Financing for 60 months at 3% interest with no money down
      works out to about $955 per month.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Hands-free power rear hatch</b> – With the key fob on your person,
        simply stick your foot under the rear bumper, and the rear hatch
        automatically opens.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dynamic Low-Beam Assist</b> – This is a fancy name for adaptive
        headlights, which bend in the direction of the front wheels to
        illuminate corners.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Power-adjustable steering wheel</b> – Changing the height and
        distance of the steering wheel is as easy as pressing a button.
